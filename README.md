## Problem statement

The movie reviews website was very happy with your deliverable for the previous assignment and now they have a new request for you. The previous consultant had created a chart for them which is illustrated on the next slide. However, the R code used to create the diagram has since been lost and cannot be recovered. Your task is to come up with the code that will re-create the same chart making it look as close as possible to the original.
